Art is an important part of the cultural and history. Many countries in the world try to preserve it by spending lots of money by building the art centre, museum and promoting the old legacy. Few people are of the opnion that it is thoroughly waste of government funds and they say it should be spent on the other important tasks. I am strongly favouring the first view of investment in the art because it will give the good message to the public for the art.

Firstly, the art and culture is backbone of any socity. Its way of representation has changed throughout the human history. In the ancient times, the art is usually depicts on the wall of caves or on the tree leaf.  Investing public funds in this kind gesture will aware people more about the their rich cultural.  Alongside this, fine art is also in very demand through out world and many foreign tourist which we raise the government reverse. Anyone can learn and showcase his talent. This will not only help the world to grow better but also become the bread butter for many.


However, many believe this amount could be used in another good will work like education, water supply or on the infrasturcture purposes. Many countries such as Nepal or Srilanka who are already in the debt can not afford this.

In conclusion, art give right path to socities in many ways and it is integral part of numerous inhabitants. It shold be preserve and prompt by governments.
